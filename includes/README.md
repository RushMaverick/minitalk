Libft, a Hive Helsinki project. 

Project Description
What your application does,
Why you used the technologies you used,
Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.

Hello dear reader! If you are reading this you might be interested in knowing what my project provides.

Libft was the first project me and many other talented programmers tackled at Hive Helsinki. This project is the result of that and provided us with our own library to set our own made functions into.

A library can be defined as a collection of different functions or source code that can compile into a package. For this specific project, I have programmed base functions used within different programs, like for example putstr which puts any given string to output or split which splits a string using a given delimiter. This project gave insight into memory and string manipulation for me, it has and will be useful to me and hopefully others as well.

The point with this project was to learn how to manipulate memory directly by having us Hivers recreate the basic functions without using pre-existing libraries. Tedious, one might think, but a very necessary step I'd say. My journey into programming started with this project and I have struggled and battled with everything from void pointers to memory leaks, becoming a bit more wise with every mistake and failure along the way. I learned the fundamentals of the C language from the get-go and I feel I have a better understanding of programming as thanks to that.
I will continue to update and add functions to this library as I develop more. Maybe it already looks much different from when I wrote this readme? Anyway, let's move on.

1. How to Install and Run the Project
The project is ready to be used when downloaded, so no installing required! 
However, it is worth noting that the library of functions needs to be referenced using its header file [#include "libft.h"] in your source code before referencing any of the functions.
