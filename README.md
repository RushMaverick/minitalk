Certainly! Here's a README for your Minitalk project:

# Minitalk

Minitalk is a simple communication program consisting of a client and a server, written in C for UNIX environments. The program enables communication between processes using UNIX signals, specifically SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.

## Features

- **Client-Server Communication**: Minitalk facilitates communication between a client and a server process.
- **Quick Response**: The server promptly displays received messages, ensuring efficient communication.
- **PID Display**: The server prints its Process ID (PID) upon startup.
- **Error Handling**: Thorough error handling ensures the program doesn't quit unexpectedly and avoids memory leaks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd minitalk
```

3. Compile the source files using the provided Makefile:

```bash
make
```

## Usage

### Server

1. Start the server:

```bash
./server
```

2. Note the displayed PID for future reference.

### Client

1. Execute the client, providing the server's PID and the message to send:

```bash
./client [server_PID] [message]
```

Replace `[server_PID]` with the PID of the server obtained during server startup, and `[message]` with the desired message to send.

## Example

1. Start the server:

```bash
./server
```

2. Note the server's PID displayed in the console.

3. In a separate terminal, execute the client with the server's PID and a message:

```bash
./client [server_PID] "Hello, server!"
```

Replace `[server_PID]` with the server's PID obtained in step 2.

4. The server should promptly display the received message.
